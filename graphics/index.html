          <h2 class="heading">Logos</h2>

          <p>These logos include conceptual logos as well as iterations for freelance jobs. Many of these come
            from my contribution to the Daily Logo Challenge, where participants are given a prompt everyday for
            a logo. They are then to post their work to a social media site- I posted my logos onto Instagram with the
            challenges' hashtag: #dailylogochallenge. My instagram can be found at @dani_by_design</p>

            <h3 class="heading">Packaging</h3>

            <h4 class="subheading">Maizme</h4>

            <img src="images/maizme/Maizme.png" alt="Maizme logo" width="543">

            <p>The Maizme project is a demonstration of the full-cycle implementation of a novel grocery product, from
              the concept to the identity to the packaging prototype. The prompt was to create a novel grocery item,
              develop an idenity for it, as well as design and physically build the packaging, and one feature had
              to draw inspiration from something found in nature, incorporating biomimicry.</p>

              <h5 class="subheading">Logo</h5>
              <p>The logo integrates the word "maize" to refer to the crop of corn, and "me" added to the
                end completes to sound like a way of saying "amaze me," which is exactly what I would hope my
                audience would be when they use the product. The product is overall a kit for learning how to make homemade
                popcorn.  This product is meant for individuals that want to learn
                something new, and who love popcorn.</p>

                <img src="images/maizme/PackageLidCard.png" alt="package and lid">

                <h6 class="subheading">Packaging Concept/Biomimacry</h6>
                <p>The 3 unique features are as follows: a recipe and ingredients for making popcorn (kernels and spices), a convenient located compartment of spices,
                  and finally a sturdy packaging that acts as a bowl and prevents spillage and encourages sharing. The biomimicry
                  that is included in the string-pull spices compartment comes from a mechanism found in honeysuckle flowers: the bottom of the flower bud can be pulled
                  and a "string," that is the male part of the flower, simultaneously pushing a bubble of nectar-
                  delicious to taste.</p>

                  <h7 class="subheading">Final Packaging</h7>

                  <p>The final result is a wide cyndrical shaped packaging that stands sturdy and prevents spillage of popcorn.
                    Fitted to the bowl is a lid that has the unique "string" feature. After the popcorn is ready, the lid can be
                    reattached to the bowl and by pulling a string, spices and flavoring can be released into the bowl from a
                    concealed compartment inside of the lid. With the lid securely shut, the packaging is shakable and thus will spread
                    the seasoning onto the popcorn. The lid can then be discarded and delicious popcorn is ready to share.</p>
